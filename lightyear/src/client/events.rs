//! Bevy [`Event`](bevy::prelude::Event) that are emitted when certain network events occur on the client
//!
//! You can use this to react to network events in your game systems.
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use bevy::ecs::event::EventId;
//! fn handle_message(mut messages: EventReader<MessageEvent<MyMessage>>) {
//!   for event in messages.read() {
//!     // the event has two functions `message()` and `context()`
//!     // `context()` is currently unused but is reserved for future uses (e.g. to get the sender of the message, or the tick it was sent on)
//!     let message = event.message();
//!     // do something with the message
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
